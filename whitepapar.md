# OPL - a cryptocurrency with a practical mindset

> Summary: This is a project based on the core developed by Satoshi Nakamoto，with Dash as a basis upon which improvements were implemented to anonymous payments. It has inherited the prominent features and extended with Light Nodes, Lightning Chain and Offline transactions.

## Features

As of now there has only been very few projects compatible with Lightning Network causing transaction liquidity deteriorates, extending transaction times and most altcoins has no practical use in the end. OPL has inherited the features of Dash and has extended its capabilities for transactions. We hope OPL can be used for both online and offline transactions, we would also provide support for bridging into the blockchain by improving development quality and speed.

## Light Node

With the growth of size in blockchain and wallet client, most Bitcoin or Ethereum products require downloads in excess of 100G data. This is a huge hurdle for most users, even if most of them will not directly participate in the act of network consensus.

With the integration of merkle-Patricia-Tree and Headers Chain concept, protocol can allow the system to discard old blocks and operate with minimal data set, the full set of blockchain data will be stored on Masternodes and community nodes.

## Lightning Node

Used to wrap Lightning data and store Lightning history for the Lightning protocol.

## Lightning Chain

Constructed by Lightning Nodes, used for broadcasting Lightning data. We guarantee the transactions between nodes to be low latency and high usability, this will allow the broadcast of information to be within three seconds.


## Lightning Node Reward

Once the number of transaction of Lightning Network has critical mass, Nodes will require more collateral.

Lightning Nodes are different to normal Masternodes, requiring lower latency to ensure stability. When the network supporting nodes providing services can be rewarded, this incentivizes investment with significant returns. The plan is to have 40% of the block rewards to support this initiative.

Lightning node reward will be a fixed percentage including the following:

- participate in the enveloping of Lightning Data, sharing of fees with Masternodes
- Masternode rewards

## Lightning Transaction

To carry the information required for Lightning Data, used for Lightning Chain and broadcast of transactions.
Lightning transactions will be divided into public and private methods to satisfy requirements for laws of different countries.

## Better integration for development

New transaction nodes or light nodes will be compatible with Dash RPC ports, the OPL team will support integration with applications of mainstream development languages.

## ASIC Resistant Algorithm X16R[^1]

The appearance of ASIC has caused the Bitcoin hash rate to greatly increase, improving security for the network. However the issue introduced is that most of the hash power is concentrated on a few mining pools. The decentralization has threatened the healthy development of Bitcoin network. When Satoshi designed Bitcoin, the original purpose is for hash power to be distributed.

Other cryptocurrencies have attempted to combat the issue of centralization by introducing different hashing algorithms, such as Litecoin with Scrypt, it has succeeded for a period of time but with the introduction of ASIC for different algorithms, these cryptocurrencies face similar issues.

Therefore, with the algorithm X16R developed by Tron Black and Joel Weight using 16 different algorithms has considered the complexity of ASIC design. It has been suggested that it would take much longer to develop ASIC for this particular algorithm compared to Bitcoin and will allow the larger community to participate for longer periods.
We genuinely believe in the importance of community with the growth of any project.


## Offline Trnasaction

Used for preparing transactions without the presence of internet.

## Ecosystem

OPL team will strive to establish a development friendly ecosystem.
OPL community will take the initiative in reaching out the developers and commercial partners.
40% of the premine will be used to incentivize community and open source development. The team will invest in innovative ideas to supporting development of community voted applications.
